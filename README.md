Benign and Malignant tumor Detection

In this project, I have used CNN to detect glioma tumor which is one form of Glioblastoma tumor. This tumor are pretty benign. But this kind of tumor is often misidentified by the doctor. Hence, the diagnosis becomes difficult for the doctor. So, I build a classifier that classify benign brain tumor, glioma and malignant tumor like-Meningioma. I build a server for doctor to send the image. It worked at first but there are coding issue for which it is not working now.
